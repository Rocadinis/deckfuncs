Deckfuncs is a library for card-based games.
IMPORTANT! If you are going to use these functions, keep in mind that the variables correspondant to Hands, Decks and Graveyards (if this last one does exist) need to be Lists in order for these functions to work, since this library heavily uses List operations.
Also, here's some friendly advice. Remember that these functions TAKE OUT cards from decks, which means the number of cards decrease, too. You may or may not want to increase / decrease the values of variables that count the number of cards on hands, decks, graveyards, or length functions... It's up to you!


draw(deckVar, handVar):

Draws the top card of a deck, deckVar (where you should put a variable correspondant to a deck), and places it on a hand - handVar (a hand variable.). This also RETURNS the drawn card. It will raise an error if the number of cards is 0 or less.
Example: draw(myDeck, myHand, True)


search(card, deckVar, handVar, shuffleAfter):

Adds a card from a deck (deckVar) to a hand (handVar), and RETURNS the card. 'card' can be treated as, for example, a variable or list element. Only one card of the given name is taken, not all occurences!

Example: search("Swamp", myDeck, myHand) - This would search a deck for a card named 'Swamp' and put it on a player's hand. It returns "Swamp".

search(myDeck[2], myDeck, myHand, True) - This would search for the third card on top of a player's deck and put it on their hand. It would return the third card, and since shuffleAfter is true, it would then shuffle the deck.


bury(card, deckVar, gyVar, shuffleAfter):

Sends a card from a deck (deckVar) to a graveyard / discard pile (gyVar), and RETURNS the sent card. 'card' can be treated as, for example, a variable or list element. Only one card of the given name is taken, not all occurences!

Example: bury("Zombie", myDeck, graveyard, True) - This would send a card named "Zombie" from a deck to the graveyard / discard pile. It returns "Zombie", and the deck is shuffled after that.


discard(card, handVar, gyVar):

Discards a card (card) from the hand (handVar) and sends it to the graveyard / discard pile (gyVar), then RETURNS the card sent.

Example: discard("Human", myHand, graveyard) - This would discard a card named "Human" from a player's hand to the graveyard.


mill(deckVar, gyVar, number):

Sends the top X cards (number) of a deck to the graveyard / discard pile (gyVar). Then, it RETURNS a list with the milled cards. Keep in mind that the last cards that go into the graveyard will effectively be in the first positions in the graveyard / discard pile list.

Example: mill(myDeck, gy, 3) - This would send the top 3 cards of a deck to the graveyard / discard pile. Let's suppose those milled cards were, for example, "Island", "Erasure", "Giant". It would return a list with those values.


returnCard(card, deckVar, gyVar, shuffleAfter):

Returns a card (card) to a deck (deckVar) from a graveyard / discard pile (gyVar). It RETURNS the chosen card.

Example: returnCard("Island", myDeck, graveyard, False) - This would return a card named "Island" from a deck to the graveyard / discard pile, then return "Island". Since shuffleAfter is false, the deck would not be shuffled.


gyToHand(card, gyVar, handVar):

Returns a card (card) from a graveyard / discard pile (gyVar) to the hand (handVar). It RETURNS the chosen card.

Example: gyToHand("Dinosaur", graveyard, myHand) - This would return a card named "Dinosaur" from the graveyard / discard pile to the hand, then return "Dinosaur".


topDeck(card, deckVar, gyVar):

Returns a card (card) from a graveyard / discard pile (gyVar) to the top of a deck (deckVar). It first checks if the graveyard is empty and raises an error if that is the case - then RETURNS the chosen card.

Example: topDeck("Super Key", myDeck, graveyard) - This would return a card named "Super Key" to the top of a deck (assuming the graveyard is not empty)


bottomDeck(card, deckVar, gyVar):

Returns a card (card) from a graveyard / discard pile (gyVar) to the bottom of a deck (deckVar). It first checks if the graveyard is empty and raises an error if that is the case - then RETURNS the chosen card.

Example: bottomDeck("Dungeon", myDeck, graveyard) - This would return a card named "Dungeon" to the bottom of a deck (assuming the graveyard is not empty)


viewTopCards(deckVar, numCards):

Views the top X cards (numCards) from a deck (deckVar). It RETURNS a list with the seen cards.

Example: viewTopCards(deck, 2) - for a deck with the cards ["1", "2", "3", "4"] (in this specific order), it would return the list ["1", "2"].


shuffleHandIntoDeck(deckVar, handVar):

Shuffles an entire hand (handVar) into a deck (deckVar), then RETURNS a list containing the shuffled cards.

Example: shuffleHandIntoDeck(deck, myHand) - Returns all the cards in myHand to deck, then shuffles the deck and returns the list of the shuffled cards.


shuffleGYIntoDeck(deckVar, gyVar):

Shuffles an entire graveyard / discard pile (gyVar) into a deck (deckVar), then RETURNS a list containing the shuffled cards.

Example: shuffleGYIntoDeck(deck, graveyard) - Returns all the cards in the graveyard to deck, then shuffles the deck and returns the list of the shuffled cards.


findCopies(card, target):

Finds copies of a card (card) inside a list (target), then RETURNS a list with the found copies.

Example: findCopies("Super Creature", deck) - This would find all instances of "Super Creature" found in a deck (list), then return a list containing all copies of "Super Creature" found there.


cut(deckVar, shuffleBefore):

Cuts a deck (deckVar) into two halves (rounded down). If shuffleBefore is true, this function shuffles the deck before cutting it, and RETURNS a tuple with the two halves. Check the examples folder for an example.

Example: cut(deck, True) - On a deck of 10 cards, this would cut the deck two halves (thus, 5 cards each). The deck would be shuffled beforehand.


dice(sides):

Rolls a die with X sides (sides variable), RETURNING a random number.

Example: dice(6) - Rolls a die with 6 sides, returning a number from 1 to 6.
